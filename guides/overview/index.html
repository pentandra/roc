                      roc is modular, so you only need to use what you want to. One the other hand, we want to provide as much help as possible to help you build a successful, scalable, and domain-specific system.

                      roc core is the starting point for designing a domain-specific research system. We are using the approach of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}guides/domain-driven-design">Domain Driven Design</a> to help you make sure that your systems really fit the domain that you are trying to support. roc core gives you a simple model of research elements to build your domain model upon.
