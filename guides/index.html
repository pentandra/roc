                      Welcome to the roc guides! These guides are designed to
                      take you from a beginner to an expert roc developer,
                      being able to design research applications that
                      effectively model your research domain and can handle the
                      intense loads required for open research.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                      We’re super excited about the applications that you’re
                      going to build with roc, and the immense value that will
                      be created by doing research this way. This will change
                      the world and make your research so much more useful to
                      yourself and others.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                      The guides are arranged in order, starting from
                      conceptual foundations, then proceeding to more
                      application-specific implementation. So proceed in order
                      for a more pragmatic approach, or skip around to what
                      seems most interesting to you.
