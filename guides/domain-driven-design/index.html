                      This guide is not intended to be an overview of domain-driven design, but our experience of the importance of using it in the development of your research system. There are many better resources on the web, and, of course, the book by Eric Evans, to learn about domain-driven design itself.

                      In trying to design our first research system, we quickly realized that we needed to design something unique for that domain. A general, domain-agnostic research system just wouldn't have the vocabulary and understanding needed to preserve the research context. Designing a one-size-fits-all research system would not really help the researcherâ€”it would actually get in the way.

                      Our approach, then, to designing the research system was to use domain-driven design. We have followed this approach in designing roc, and recommend that approach in designing your research system. Doing this, we cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of really understanding how research is done in that domain. The developers <em>must</em> have a good understanding of the domain if they are going to be successful.
