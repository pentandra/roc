                        <h2>Why is the acronym <em>ROC</em> instead of <em>ORC</em>?</h2>
                        <p>

                          In the spirit of OWL, we are shamelessly rearranging the letters of the acronym to be <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/CorePresentations/RDFTutorial/Slides.html#(114)">more disirable</a>.  It is also a play on <em>rock</em>-solid research, since we hope that ROC helps to make research conclusions more solid and transparent.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Plus, ORC sounds like something you would do when you are sick.

                      <h2>Why is roc being sponsored by a commercial company?</h2>
                      <p>

                        Business models for software companies have changed a lot in the last fifteen years. Early software companies chose to make money by forcing an artificial scarcity of a valueless commodity: copies of software. That has never and will never provide real value to its customers. Letâ€™s face it: bits are cheap.

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        Newer business models are being adopted or created by companies, such as <a href="http://pentandra.com">Pentandra</a>, that are designed to provide real value to their clients. It is a win-win situation both for the company and their clients. For us, revenue comes from consulting and from adding value to the research process, not from selling software or setting ourselves up as <a href="http://pentandra.com/blog/a-social-business/#p[OvoObm],h[OvoObm,2]">the gatekeepers of knowledge dissemination.</a>

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        Developing roc under the umbrella of a commercial company will provide continuity to the project and the flexibility to get many people involved, no matter what affiliation they have.

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        We also think the best vehicle to displace the modus operandi of scholarly publishing is a different type of commercial company (one with a better flavor), not government legislation (though that can definitely help).

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        Other reasons include that we wanted to be independent financially, not having to rely on grants from a third party, even from a government, for project survival. Grants are really not the best fit for an ongoing software project. We also wanted to be able to pivot as needed without having to worry about unfinished proposed deliverables. When it comes down to it, we want to focus on writing great software instead of on writing great grant proposals.

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        roc is free, open source and always will be.
