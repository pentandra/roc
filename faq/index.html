                        <h2>Why is the acronym <em>ROC</em> instead of <em>ORC</em>?</h2>
                        <p>

                          In the spirit of OWL, we are shamelessly rearranging the letters of the acronym to be <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/CorePresentations/RDFTutorial/Slides.html#(114)">more disirable</a>.  It is also a play on <em>rock</em>-solid research, since we hope that ROC helps to make research conclusions more solid and transparent.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Plus, ORC sounds like something you would do when you are sick.

                      <h2>Why is roc being sponsored by a commercial company?</h2>
                      <p>

                        Newer business models are being adopted or created by companies, such as <a href="http://pentandra.com">Pentandra</a>, that are designed to provide lasting value to their clients. It is a win-win situation both for the company and their clients. For us, revenue comes from consulting and from adding value to the research process, not from selling software or setting ourselves up as <a href="http://pentandra.com/blog/a-social-business/#p[OvoObm],h[OvoObm,2]">the gatekeepers of knowledge dissemination.</a>

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        While government legislation is being used to keep greedy publishers at bay and enforce open access to publications, we think the best vehicle to displace the modus operandi of scholarly publishing is a to introduce a completely new approach to research publication in which the benefits of transitioning outweigh the costs.
                      
                      </p>
                      <p>

                        Developing roc under the umbrella of a commercial company will provide continuity to the project and the flexibility to get many people involved, no matter what affiliation they have. We believe that will be able to do more good as a for-profit company than as a not-for-profit.

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        Other reasons include that we wanted to be independent financially, not having to rely on grants from a third party, even from a government, for project survival. Grants are really not the best fit for an ongoing software project. We also wanted to be able to pivot as needed without having to worry about unfinished proposed deliverables. When it comes down to it, we want to focus on writing great software instead of on writing great grant proposals.

                        roc is free, open source and always will be.

                    <section id="namespace">
                      <h2>Why is roc namespaced under com.pentandra instead of org.openresearchcore? I thought this was an open project?</h2>
                      <p>

                        This is one of those difficult decisions that we had to make. We thought about just leaving off the namespace, but then realized that we really <em>need</em> to promote our company name and what it stands for. We have a social mission to change the way people think about research. Our code, for the most part, is not proprietary, but open. Our mission and even our company is open. By avoiding the use of a “com” namespace, it felt like we were apologizing for our commercial status. We are not that type of commercial company.

                      </p>
                      <p>

                        If you disagree with our decision, that is fine. We would be willing to change our minds if you can come up with a better argument and convince us to switch.
