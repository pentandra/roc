                        <h2>Why is the acronym <em>ROC</em> instead of <em>ORC</em>?</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the spirit of OWL, we are shamelessly
                            rearranging the letters of the acronym to be
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/CorePresentations/RDFTutorial/Slides.html#(114)">more disirable</a>.
                            It is also a play on rock-solid research, since we
                            hope that ROC helps to make research conclusions more solid
                            and transparent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plus, ORC sounds like something you would do when you
                            are sick.
