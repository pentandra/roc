                        <h2>What is the Open Research Core?</h2>
                        <p>The Open Research Core, also known as ROC, is a lightweight open-source framework for the development of domain-specific collaborative research systems. This is an attempt to “break through” the barriers to the dissemination of research and to support open research collaboration.</p>

                        <h2>Lightweight</h2>
                        <p>The ROC is highly modular, so you only need to use what you need.</p>

                      <h2>For Domain-Specific Research Systems</h2>
                      <p>While it can be tempting to build a one-size-fits-all generic research system, research software needs to be designed specifically for the domain it is trying to support. Every research domain has it's own unique vocabulary and idiosyncrasies. Yet, underlying all is a quest for an answer—a search for truth. The ROC pares the research process down to the bare essentials, allowing you to build domain-specific research systems without needing to start from scratch.</p>

                      <h2>Collaborative</h2>
                      <p>Open research and research collaboration are <a href="http://pentandra.com/research/#future">the future of research</a>. Yet creating collaborative research software has turned into a research domain of its own. When you are doing collaborative anything, there is a lot that needs to be right for the end product to be performant, scalable, and maintainable. ROC is designed to help you get started on the right foot.</p>
