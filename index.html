                        <h1>Open Research Core</h1>
                        <p>The Open Research Core, also known as <em>roc</em>, is a lightweight open-source framework for the development of domain-specific collaborative research systems.</p>

                        <h2>An Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                          
                          Speaking collectively, our practices of disseminating research are outdated and inefficient. (This should not come as a surprise to you). The common practice of writing a paper to publish research disseminates only a tiny portion (the tip of the iceberg) of the actual research outputs, making it difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce or verify the accuracy of the research. It is important to publish not only <em>what</em> data was used in the research process, but <em>how</em> that data was used to answer the research question. roc is a from-the-ground-up redesign of the current publishing paradigm—an attempt to “break through” the barriers of the dissemination of research and to support open research collaboration.

                          roc is a work in progress. While we have a vision of what roc could become, this vision is dependent on people like you, so that this can this project can reach its fullest potential. We want this to become a shared vision and collaboration, so we can reinvent research publication and dissemination, together.

                            <h3>Lightweight</h3>
                            <p>roc is highly modular, so you only use what you need, and is designed to be used as a starting point upon which to build domain-specific research systems.</p>
                            <p>Built on the JVM, you can develop roc-based research applications initially in Scala or Java. Support for Groovy, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and CoffeeScript is in the plans.</p>

                          <h3>Supporting Domain-Specific Research Systems</h3>
                          <p>While it can be tempting to build a one-size-fits-all generic research system, we think research software needs to be designed specifically for the domain it is trying to support. Every research domain has it’s own unique vocabulary and idiosyncrasies. Yet, underlying all is a quest for an answer—a search for truth. roc pares the research process down to the bare essentials, making it possible to build domain-specific research systems without needing to start from scratch.</p>

                          <h3>Contextual</h3>
                          <p>

                            roc compartmentalizes research into little units called <em>cases</em>. A case starts with a question and keeps track of not only <em>which</em> data was used, but <em>how</em> that data was used to answer the research question. By so doing, the case acts as the research context, preserving all the effort that was spent finding an answer to the question. 

                          </p>
                          <p>

                            Once a question has been found, that case can be closed and then used to compose conclusions in subsequent cases.

                          </p>
                          <p>
                            
                            Cases are general enough to support any type of hypothesis-driven research.

                          <h3>Collaborative</h3>
                          <p>Open research and research collaboration are <a href="http://pentandra.com/research/#future">the future of research</a>. Yet creating collaborative research software has turned into a research field of its own. When you are doing collaborative anything, there is a lot that needs to be right for the end product to be performant, scalable, and maintainable. roc is designed to help you get started on the right foot.</p>

                          <h3>Built Upon Standards</h3>
                          <p>

                            By building upon open standards, roc provides a foundation for open research systems, enabling disparate systems to talk to each other, accelerating new connections and breakthroughs, even across disciplines.

                          <p>
                            
                            roc builds upon standards from the research, web, and knowledge management communities, including the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Open Annotation Collaboration</a> and specifications from the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative</a>. If you have developed or are using a standard or ontology that you feel would be a great addition to roc, <a href="https://github.com/pentandra/roc/pulls">submit a pull request</a> or talk with us!
