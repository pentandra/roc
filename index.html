                        <h1>Open Research Core</h1>
                        <p>The Open Research Core, also known as <em>roc</em>, is a lightweight open-source framework for the development of domain-specific collaborative research systems.</p>

                        <h2>An Overview</h2>
                        <p>It should not come as a surprise to you that our practices of disseminating research are outdated and
                          inefficient. The common practice of writing a paper 
                          to publish research disseminates only a
                          tiny portion (the tip of the iceberg) of the actual
                          research outputs, making it difficult, if not
                          impossible, to reproduce or verify the accuracy of the
                          research. It is important to publish not only
                          <em>what</em>
                          data was used in the research process, but
                          <em>how</em> that data was used to answer the
                          research question. roc is a from-the-ground-up
                          redesign of the current publishing paradigm—an
                          attempt to “break through” the barriers of the dissemination of research and to support open research collaboration.</p>

                            <h3>Lightweight</h3>
                            <p>roc is highly modular, so you only need to use
                              what you need. Built on the JVM, you can develop
                              roc-based research applications in Scala or Java.
                              Developing in Groovy, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and CoffeeScript is in the plans.</p>

                          <h3>Supporting Domain-Specific Research Systems</h3>
                          <p>While it can be tempting to build a one-size-fits-all generic research system, we think research software needs to be designed specifically for the domain it is trying to support. Every research domain has it’s own unique vocabulary and idiosyncrasies. Yet, underlying all is a quest for an answer—a search for truth. roc pares the research process down to the bare essentials, making it possible to build domain-specific research systems without needing to start from scratch.</p>

                          <h3>Collaborative</h3>
                          <p>Open research and research collaboration are <a href="http://pentandra.com/research/#future">the future of research</a>. Yet creating collaborative research software has turned into a research field of its own. When you are doing collaborative anything, there is a lot that needs to be right for the end product to be performant, scalable, and maintainable. roc is designed to help you get started on the right foot.</p>

                          <h3>Built Upon Standards</h3>
                          <p>It builds upon standards from the research, web, and knowledge management communities, including the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Open Annotation Collaboration</a> and specifications from the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative</a>.</p>
