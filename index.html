          <h3>What is the Open Research Core?</h3>

<p>The Open Research Core, also known as ROC, is a lightweight open-source framework for the development of domain-specific collaborative research systems. This is an attempt to "break through" the barriers to the dissemination of research and to support open research collaboration.</p>

<h3>Lightweight</h3>

<p>Every research domain has it's own unique vocabulary and idiosyncrasies. Yet, underlying all is a quest for an answer---a search for truth. </p>

<h3>Domain-Specific</h3>

<p>While the ROC is mostly domain-independent, we believe that research sys</p>

<h3>Collaborative</h3>

<p>Open research and research collaboration are <a href="http://pentandra.com/research/#future">the future of research</a>. Yet creating collaborative research software has turned into a research domain of its own. When you are doing collaborative anything, there is a lot that needs to be right for the end product to be performant, scalable, and maintainable. ROC is designed to help you get started on the right foot.</p>

<h3>Built Upon Standards</h3>

<p>It builds upon standards from the research, web, and knowledge management communities, including the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Open Annotation Collaboration</a> and the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative</a>.</p>
